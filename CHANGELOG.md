## Unreleased

### Added

* Support for GraalVM `native-image`

### Changed

* Updated JNA to 5.16.0

## [2.11] - 2021-10-02

### Added

* `argon2-jvm-nolibs` is now a multi-release JAR with a `module-info` file for Java >=
  11. ([PR](https://github.com/phxql/argon2-jvm/pull/85))
* Added support for context secrets and associated data ([PR](https://github.com/phxql/argon2-jvm/pull/86))

## [2.10.1] - 2021-04-06

### Changed

* Updated JNA to 5.8.0

## [2.10] - 2021-04-06

### Added

- Added support for Apple's M1 ([PR](https://github.com/phxql/argon2-jvm/pull/82), [VirusTotal scan of the binary](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file-analysis/ZDQ3ZTQ1ZTIxNTYzY2YyZmU5ZGJjYzQyNGY5ZWY4MzY6MTYxNDA2NzU3MA==/detection))

### Fixed

- Fixed invalid automatic module name in argon2-nolibs. It's now `de.mkammerer.argon2.nolibs`.

## [2.9.1] - 2021-01-30

### Fixed

- Fixed duplicate `Automatic-Module-Name` in manifest, see [this issue](https://github.com/phxql/argon2-jvm/issues/80).

## [2.9] - 2021-01-05

### Changed

- Cleaned up the mess with the Gradle modules. To fix that in clean manner, the artifact structure has slightly changed.
  Consumers of the library shouldn't notice that, but `argon2-jvm` only contains the argon2 binary libraries
  while `argon2-jvm-nolibs`
  contains the Java code. `argon2-jvm` depends on `argon2-jvm-nolibs`, which in turn depends on JNA.

## [2.8] - 2020-12-12

### Added

- Added method `hashAdvanced` to `Argon2Advanced` which lets the caller specify the argon2 version
- Added methods `generateSalt` to `Argon2Advanced` which generates salt with either the default or the given length
- Added OSGi entries to the JAR manifest

### Changed

- Improved the [compatibility list](compatibility-tests/README.md)
- Updated JNA to 5.6.0

## [2.7] - 2020-04-15

### Added
- Added method `needsRehash` to check if a hash needs to be upgraded
- Updated JNA to 5.5.0

### Changed

## [2.6] - 2019-10-06

### Added
- Added methods `hash` and `rawHash` for byte arrays
- Added method `pbkdf` to ease generating key material from a password

- Update Argon2 libraries to 20190702
- Update JNA to 5.4.0

## [2.5] - 2018-10-07

### Added
- Added method in `Argon2Advanced` which takes a pre-generated salt. See [#45](https://github.com/phxql/argon2-jvm/issues/45)
- Added warmup runs in the `Argon2Helper.findIterations` method to reduce JIT-related timing issues

## [2.0] - 2016-10-03
*Attention*: This release sets the default charset to UTF-8 instead of using the system default. If your system default
haven't been UTF-8, refactor your code to use the overloads which accept `Charset`

### Added
- Specified the release from which the binaries have been built (see README.md in the `resources` folder). See #7
- Added overloads to hash and verify methods which accept `char[]` for password. See #9
- Added overloads to hash and verify methods which accept a `Charset`. See #10

### Changed
- Recompiled libraries for Linux x86 and x64 and for Windows x86 and x64
- The internal arrays which contain the passwords are now wiped after hash creation / verification. See #9
- Changed the default charset from JVM system default to UTF-8. See #10
